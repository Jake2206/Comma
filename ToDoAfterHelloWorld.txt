Permissable in language right now that should not be:
	- Declaring variable with same name as function argument
	- 

Not permissable in language right now that should be:
	- Declare variables without assignment
	- (not sure) Reassignment of already declared variable
	- Declare variables within a scope (if, for not working) -> parser error
	- Nul cannot be returned from a function?
	
Need to add:
	- Add standard library functions to semantic checker (semant.ml)
